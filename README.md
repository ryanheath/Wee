# Wee (C# Compiler)

Wee is a Hobby programming language. It is called Wee because "Wee" is a colloquial term that means very small or tiny. It's often used in British English and informal conversation to describe something of a diminutive size, according to ChatGPT.
And it sounds cool 😎

I took a different approach: instead of using an assembler to create an executable I created an interpreter to run the compiled source.

I also want to keep everything in one file: Program.cs, because it is "Wee" 😁

## Running the interpreter

Run the following command in the source folder

```
dotnet watch run source.wee
```

Now you can edit the source.wee file and get immediate feedback.
